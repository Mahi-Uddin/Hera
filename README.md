Hera
=========================

A work-in-progress client for Supercell games under the GPLv3 license!

Currently, the client only supports Clash Royale, but we will make it more versatile as time goes on.

To build this software on Linux/macOS or other UNIX platforms, use `gradlew`. On Windows, use `gradlew.bat`. To make a build, run your platform's command followed by a space then `build`; e.g.: `./gradlew build`. Your jar file can be found under `build/libs` as `Hera.jar`
